# Campsite Finder

## As a camper I want an app that I can search arears for National campgrounds and chose which one to stay at by what is available with in the park.
      WHEN: I select a campground
      THEN: I see what trails, beaches, hunting areas, and plants will be available to see or visit at that campground
      
      WHEN: I want to know more about the National Park Service for that park.
      TTHEN: I will be presented events, news, alerts, and more.
      
      WHEN: I need to find the contact information for the park
      THEN: I should see a contact link that will display (addresses, contacts, hours of operations.
      
      WHEN: I want to see videos of the park I selected.
      THEN: A video will play created by the National parks if available.
