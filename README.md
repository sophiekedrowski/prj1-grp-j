# Campsite Finder

## As a camper I want a website that I can search areas for National Park campgrounds and chose which one to stay at by what is available with in the park.

    GIVEN: I need a webpage to search and display campsites near me.

    WHEN: I search a radius around a given city
    THEN: I am presented with the campsites and parks within the search area

    WHEN: Campsites are presented
    THEN: I am given the number of camping sites at each location, a brief description and the campsite link

    WHEN: I press on the campsite link
    THEN: I am directed to National Park webpage for that park

    WHEN: When I go to the National Park webpage
    THEN: I will be presented with events, news, alerts, and more for that location
